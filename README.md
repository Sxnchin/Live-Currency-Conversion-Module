# Live-Currency-Conversion-Module
A unique currency conversion and price modeling predictor I'm working on.
It's essentially a cool little program that checks live currency exchange rates across different markets and exchanges, highlighting discrepancies and making predictions of future price fluctuations
I think endgame for this project is find a way to publish it as an API for general use, or as a package.
